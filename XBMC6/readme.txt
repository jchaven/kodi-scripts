This Kodi box is in Charlotte and has no NAS from which to pull content.

For content it will be pulling from the ProRAID Raid box currently used to 
backup the NAS in High Point. XBMC6 is running on the RPi4 that supports USB3.

The RPi4 mounts the ProRAID box to: /media/Proraid

All scripts have been altered to use the Proraid mount point instead of the 
NAS mount point. Scripts are stored in: /storage/scripts
